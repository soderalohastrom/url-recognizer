# Product Context - URL Recognizer

## Why This Exists
People often remember websites vaguely - "that site with the orange logo" or "the matchmaking service with an Irish name". Current search engines require precise queries, leaving users frustrated when they can't recall exact domain names. This tool bridges that gap using AI's contextual understanding.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Memory Gaps**: Can't remember if it was .com or .org
2. **Naming Variations**: Unsure about hyphens, underscores, or camelCase in domains
3. **Contextual Recall**: Remember the site's purpose but not its name
4. **Visual Memory**: Recall logos or design elements but not URLs

## How It Should Work
1. User describes a website in natural language
2. AI interprets the description and generates a probable URL
3. System validates the URL and tries variations if needed
4. User sees the result with confidence level and screenshot
5. If high confidence, user can click through to the actual site

## User Experience Goals
- **Instant Recognition**: Users should immediately know if the found URL is correct
- **Transparency**: Show the AI's reasoning and what variations were tried
- **Visual Confirmation**: Screenshots provide immediate validation
- **Forgiving Interface**: Handle any input gracefully, from "google" to complex descriptions

## Target Users
- Anyone who frequently forgets website URLs
- People who remember sites by their content/purpose rather than names
- Users who struggle with similar-sounding domain names
- Developers testing URL variations

## Hawaiian Cultural Context
The name "Hahe Wai Mana'o" reflects the fluid nature of internet memory:
- Hahe: to search for, to seek
- Wai: water (representing the flowing, ephemeral internet)
- Mana'o: thought, memory, intention

This captures how websites flow through our memory like water, sometimes clear, sometimes elusive.
